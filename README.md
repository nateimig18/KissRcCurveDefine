# KISS RC Curve

This is a quick MATLAB script (*.m), I wrote to help me responsibly feel out a good RC curve in KISS Flight Controller that has equal sensitivity at "center-stick" & the same end points at "full-stick". It generates a number (you define) of RC curves that meet the slope & end-point criteria, while also showing the sensitivity (first difference) curves for each.
